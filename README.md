# Xcode IDE Maven Plugin 

## Overview

This Plugin integrates the [Xcode Maven Plugin](https://github.com/sap-production/xcode-maven-plugin) into Xcode. It allows to call `mvn initialize` directly from the Xcode main menu (`Project`->`Xcode Maven Plugin`) and the output is redirected to the console (`View`->`Debug Area`->`Activate Console`). Press and hold the `alt` key to get advanced `Xcode Maven Plugin` menu options.

Additionally, this project can serve as a good starting point for writing your own Xcode plugins.

## Installation

Simply build the Xcode project and restart Xcode. The plugin will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. To uninstall, just remove the plugin from there (and restart Xcode).

## Make your own plugin

If you intend to create your own plugin, here is a quickstart to save you some hours of trial and error.

1. Create a new `Bundle` project for OS X.
2. Create a new class, e.g. `MyPlugin`.
3. Add the following entries to your `Info.plist`:

        <key>NSPrincipalClass</key>
        <string>MyPlugin</string>
        <key>XC4Compatible</key>
        <true/>
        <key>XCGCReady</key>
        <true/>
        <key>XCPluginHasUI</key>
        <false/>

4. Add/set the following Build Settings to/in your target:

        DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION = YES
        DEPLOYMENT_POSTPROCESSING = YES
        DSTROOT = $(HOME)
        INSTALL_PATH = /Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins
        LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS = /Developer
        WRAPPER_EXTENSION = xcplugin
        CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC = NO
        GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_GC = supported

5. Add the following method with your initialization code to your `MyPlugin` class:

        + (void)pluginDidLoad:(NSBundle *)bundle {
            // ...
        }

* How to access/modify the main menu.
* Get the current workspace.
* Get the current scheme.
